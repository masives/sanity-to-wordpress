# What is this script?

The script goal is to make migrating from Wordpress to Sanity easier. It allows you to generate `.ndjson` file ready to be imported into your Sanity database.

Schemas are in line with default Sanity gatsby starter, which you can create on https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io%2Fsanity-template-gatsby-blog

It handles few edge cases:

- the script will warn you on images being downloaded from google cdn (which cannot be imported using sanity-cli)
- it handles more than 100 entries per type
- it allows blocklisting broken/non-existing images
- it chunks the resulting bundle into 50 documents size files

# How to run it

1. Generate bundle for migration
   ```
   node index --url https://your-site-url
   ```
// FIXME - what kind of elements the bundle contain?  You can describe here the expected result briefly. 
 
2. Import each chunk to Sanity

   Command below must be ran from your Sanity directory ie. the one containing sanity.json! // FIXME

   ```
   sanity dataset import <PATH-TO-GENERATED-NDJSON-FILE> <SANITY-DATABASE-NAME> // FIXME 
   ```

   It could look like

   ```
   sanity dataset import ../../sanity-to-wordpress-miration-tool/wordpress-data-1.ndjson production --replace
   ```

    You can add flags to replace existing documents or add only missing ones
    ```
    sanity dataset import <PATH-TO-GENERATED-NDJSON-FILE> <SANITY-DATABASE-NAME> --replace // FIXME
    sanity dataset import <PATH-TO-GENERATED-NDJSON-FILE> <SANITY-DATABASE-NAME> --missing // FIXME
    ```

# How to use blocklist

If the media asset is not available at the source Wordpress site than the sanity-cli will throw error during the import. It will looks similar to the one below.

You can see that the asset "https://10clouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/programisci-1024x683.jpg" is not available. If that's the case you can add it to blocklist array at [missingImagesBlockList.js](missingImagesBlockList.js) to and rerun script to ignore this asset.

```
➜  studio git:(master) ✗ sanity dataset import ../../sanity-to-wordpress-miration-tool/wordpress-data-2.ndjson production --replace

# How the script works

1. Download Wordpress media (images,thumbnails) as we need to include them to the new CMS.
2. Download users
3. Download categories
4. Download blogposts that will:
   1. Reference author
   2. Reference categories
   3. Have their content be written in [portable text](https://www.sanity.io/guides/introduction-to-portable-text)
   4. Have images moved along
   5. Have additional fields (seo, dates) moved along
5. Save everything in ndjson file chunks to be consumed by sanity-cli

Ndjson is split into chunks because sanity-cli will break if the resource is temporary unavailable. That way instead of retrying importing 300 documents + assets you do it only for current chunk.

# Important notes

- script doesn't check if the file provide in Wordpress exists which will break Sanity import! You have to add the url to [missingImagesBlocklist.js](missingImagesBlocklist.js)
- images are exported as enhancedImage which includes alt and caption
- you can see the reference to schema used in [schemas](./schemas) directory
- errors are input into `resources.errors.log` file

# Acknowledgments

When creating this solution I've leaned heavily on [wordpress-to-sanity repository](https://github.com/kmelve/wordpress-to-sanity).
